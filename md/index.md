# Welcome to Moska :heart:

Moska is a tool to make static pages using markdown and deploy them to github pages.

## Getting started

1. Use this template to create your copy of this repo
2. Edit files in the `md/` folder. Recommended to include `index.md` (generates `index.html`).

> [!TIP]
> Remember, your url shouldn't be directing to a `.md` file. Instead, try to direct to the `.html` file after generating.
